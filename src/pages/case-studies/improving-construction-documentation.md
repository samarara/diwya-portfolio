# Background

My experience as a product design intern at PlanGrid was quite different than previous design internships I’ve had. I was working on making improvements to an already established product on the app called ‘Field Reports’, which involved more user research and feature prioritization than I had been exposed to. This case study will walkthrough a few features that I worked on, and more importantly why it improved the overall Field Reports experience on the app. 

A field report is typically used in construction to record information on a job site. Field Reports is a section on PlanGrid that also allows similar behavior in a digitized form. This section of the app has two options, one of which is the ability to upload a pdf of an existing field work record document that the construction company uses, while the other is to use Field Report’s Native Report. 

## Discovery and Goals 

One of the primary goals in addition to improving the overall usability of Field Reports is to increase the use of Native Field Reports among customers, rather than them choosing to upload a PDF of their own. This allows for more data collection and cross integration for other PlanGrid products. 

Zendesk is a common ticketing tool used to gage what customers request for Field Reports product. It was discovered that one of the most requested feature items to be improved on since its initial release in 2017 is weather on Field Reports. An image of the old weather on Field Reports is shown below.

Users asked for more detailed information on how Weather impacted a construction site, specifically for “three time a day” weather on Field Reports. 

> If you could notate the weather throughout the day….. so if its sunny in the morning when you start your day, and turned to rain in the afternoon, it would be helpful to be able to log in and update weather…..



> Can you input multiple weather snapshots into a daily report…like at different times during the day



> Hi, is there a way to get a three time a day weather report?
