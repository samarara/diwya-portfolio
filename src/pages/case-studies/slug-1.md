# Background

My experience as a designer at PlanGrid was quite different than previous design internships I’ve had. I was working on making improvements to an already established product on the app called ‘Field Reports’, which involved more user research and feature prioritization than I had been exposed to. This case study will walkthrough a few features that I worked on, and more importantly why it improved the overall Field Reports experience on the app. 

A field report is typically used in construction to record information on a job site. Field Reports is a section on PlanGrid that also allows similar behavior in a digitized form. This section of the app has two options, one of which is the ability to upload a pdf of an existing field work record document that the construction company uses, while the other is to use Field Report’s Native Report. The two options and a user flow are shown below to provide a better understanding of the two processes: 

## Discovery and Goals

Users asked for more detailed information on how Weather impacted a construction site, specifically for “three time a day” weather on Field Reports. 

> If you could notate the weather throughout the day….. so if its sunny in the morning when you start your day, and turned to rain in the afternoon, it would be helpful to be able to log in and update weather…..
>
> Can you input multiple weather snapshots into a daily report…like at different times during the day
>
> Hi, is there a way to get a three time a day weather report?

# Design Process

Collecting user comments and feedback allowed us to define a general problem statement: 

_**How might we better show the impact of weather on a construction site on a daily basis?**_ 

This question became the lens through which I looked at my designs, and expanded into other questions that began my user research. 

## Research

Being relatively new to the construction problem space, I wanted to gain a background on how weather can impact a construction site. I began my research through existing documents already found on PlanGrid or online on the impacts of weather. Some of the impacts I found were:

* • By decreasing productivity and sometimes halting construction 
* • By ruining unprotected and exposed constructed elements 
* • By disrupting communications and/or blocking access to site locations 
* • Moreover, weather-related claims are a frequent source of dispute between contractors and project owners
* • By providing poor conditions and concerns for safety for crew members
