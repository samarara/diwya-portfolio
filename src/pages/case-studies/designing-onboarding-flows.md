# Background

Over the summer, I worked on Scotia iTRADEâ€™s on-boarding platform where clients apply for an investment account. There are 3 different new client user flows that we were designing for: 

1. Direct Client flow
2. Financial Advisor assisted flow
3. Call Centre assisted flow

Below are the information architecture flows that I helped organize and design. These flows gave a better understanding for developers and stakeholders of what was planned for the new on-boarding interface. The information architecture displayed in these flows were changed several times, and were updated accordingly:
