## Hi there! This case study is still a work in progress. Please come back in a few days!

# Background

PlanGrid is a construction productivity application used and designed for iOS, Android, Web and Windows. When I returned to PlanGrid for a second product design internship, I was given a lot more responsibility and a brand new product and team to design with. This team was called 'SiteVision' which encompasses all the photo-related tools on PlanGrid.

In construction, the ability to document the progress and issues pertaining to a construction site is extremely important for those working on the field as well as owners and superintendents who are managing those workers and the job site. With PlanGrid, users can attach photos on 'Sheets', 'Tasks' and 'Field Reports' where the photo also appears on the PlanGrid Gallery. 

## The Problem

PlanGridâ€™s photo Gallery has not been updated in over 3 years. Along with not aligning to PlanGrid's recent design system standards, the product itself was not reflecting the needs of PlanGrid users. **Users needed a way to get their photos and videos into the PlanGrid app, without having to attach them to other PlanGrid products (Sheets, Tasks, Field Reports).** 

This issue aligns with a PlanGrid user's workflow as they tend to do a site walk and capture multiple photos at once and then upload these photos to a company server or keep them on their device as there was no current method to bulk upload them onto the PlanGrid app.

## Design Solutions

.When thinking of design solutions, we looked at the common workflow our users took when capturing progress photos of a construction site. Our users would tend to do a site walk and capture multiple photos at once and then upload these photos to a company server or keep them on their device as there was no current method to bulk upload them onto the PlanGrid app. 

As a result, the bulk upload initiative was designed to allow users to upload these progress photos onto PlanGrid, in order to have all their construction documentation in one place. Below is a GIF of how the Bulk Upload modal that I designed works, as it is currently released!
