# Background

My experience as a product design intern at PlanGrid was quite different than previous design internships I’ve had. I was working on making improvements to an already established product on the app called _Field Reports_, which involved more user research and feature prioritization than I had been exposed to in the past. This case study will walkthrough a few features that I worked on, and why it improved the overall Field Reports experience on the app. 

## Discovery and Goals

One of the primary goals in addition to improving the overall usability of Field Reports is to increase the use of Native Field Reports among customers, rather than them choosing to upload a PDF of their own. This allows for more data collection and cross integration for other PlanGrid products. 

Zendesk is a common ticketing tool used to gage what customers request for Field Reports product. It was discovered that one of the most requested feature items to be improved on since its initial release in 2017 is weather on Field Reports. An image of the old weather on Field Reports is shown below.

Users asked for more detailed information on how Weather impacted a construction site, specifically for “three time a day” weather on Field Reports. 

> If you could notate the weather throughout the day….. so if its sunny in the morning when you start your day, and turned to rain in the afternoon, it would be helpful to be able to log in and update weather…..

> Can you input multiple weather snapshots into a daily report…like at different times during the day

> Hi, is there a way to get a three time a day weather report?

# Design Process

Collecting user comments and feedback allowed us to define a general problem statement: 

_**How might we better show the impact of weather on a construction site on a daily basis?**_ 

This question became the lens through which I looked at my designs, and expanded into other questions that began my user research. 

## Research

Being relatively new to the construction problem space, I wanted to gain a background on how weather can impact a construction site. I began my research through existing documents already found on PlanGrid or online on the impacts of weather. Some of the impacts I found were:

* By decreasing productivity and sometimes halting construction 
* By ruining unprotected and exposed constructed elements 
* By disrupting communications and/or blocking access to site locations 
* Moreover, weather-related claims are a frequent source of dispute between contractors and project owners
* By providing poor conditions and concerns for safety for crew members

After gaining some background knowledge, I decided to interview Customer Advocates (CA’s). CA’s  are people employed by PlanGrid with a construction background that can provide more in- depth knowledge on what the practices and pain points a user may go through on the field.
