# Background

TD was not selling their Student Lines of Credit (SLOC) in comparison to other Canadian banks even though they lead the market share in student/youth accounts. The business goal was to increase the popularity and opening of Student Lines of Credits, which are lines of credit that a person can create if they are going to a post-secondary school in Canada. However, they did not want the growth of their product to be from advertising. Instead, TDâ€™s innovation lab was given the task to promote its growth through a digital experience.

The personas that we made were for a highschool student, a university student, a graduate student, a parent with children in highschool, a parent with children under the age of 13, and a bank employee. An example of a highschool student persona is shown below.
