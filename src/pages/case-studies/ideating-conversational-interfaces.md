During my first design internship I learned and performed the Double Diamond design process.

# Background

TD was not selling their Student Lines of Credit (SLOC) in comparison to other Canadian banks even though they lead the market share in student/youth accounts. The business goal was to increase the popularity and opening of Student Lines of Credits, which are lines of credit that a person can create if they are going to a post-secondary school in Canada. However, they did not want the growth of their product to be from advertising. Instead, TD’s innovation lab was given the task to promote its growth through a digital experience.

# Empathize

Following the first Our first step was to learn about the users that we wanted to target. The best way to do so is to create personas based on qualitative and quantitative data. The personas that we made were for a highschool student, a university student, a graduate student, a parent with children in highschool, a parent with children under the age of 13, and a bank employee. An example of a highschool student persona is shown below.

Highlighted in green are the user responses that was taken from surveying each separate persona type. For example, we learned that most highschool students spend about 3 hours researching their funding options, and most believe that either their parents followed by OSAP are the most trustworthy options to accept funding for their post-secondary education. Prior to the survey, I believed that there is a stigma among everyone about taking a loan from a bank in comparison to taking a loan from the government (which is essentially the same thing as you have to pay the loan back to either option). Many of my assumptions were confirmed with this survey and the personas were then ready to analyze.

# Define

With the help of personas and our user surveys, we were able to identify the main problem for our target users and develop a problem statement:

> “How might we build an experience for people that will explain how students can best fund their education?”   

# Ideate

The next step was to ideate on solutions for this problem statement. This involves diverging into as many ideas as we can think of, and then converging into what seems realistic given our timeframe and budget.

One of the key things that we did was run a workshop filled with different ideation exercises for stakeholders. Some of the activities were meant to be ‘ice breakers’ where the stakeholders are taught not to filter their ideas, also know as the ‘Wishing’ exercise. One of the most important ones we did was called ‘Assumptions’.

## Assumptions Exercise 

n most industries and team project experiences, there can be a set of unspoken, deeply-held beliefs within a group that everyone is supposed to think or follow. If these assumptions are not acknowledged in the beginning of the design process, it can disorient a group and prevent us from suggesting new ideas and areas to improve. It is similar to wearing a set of blinders that make us unaware of our surroundings, or ignore any causes for concern. In this technique, we will each generate an assumption based on each of the following topics:

* The product we are building
* The users of the product
* The client (TD partners)
* Team roles and responsibilities

 

After these assumptions are written down, we will look at commonalities in each topic and derive a list of themes from them. This list will then be presented and approved by everyone in the group as well as questioned in order to understand why we assume certain ideas.

## Customer Journey Exercise

We took our assumptions and thought of guiding principles for the product we wish to make. A customer journey exercise as seen below was done that focuses on how a typical user would learn about a financial product, as that is the digital experience we  were planning to make.
