# Background

Serialize is a collaboration tool for photographers to create and curate photography series. It is a passion project that I am currently working on to build an eventual mobile application. This case study will walkthrough some of my ideation process and the decision making behind the product's main interaction patterns. 

## What is a photography series?

My definition of a photography series is: 

> _A set of photos connected by the concepts, visual aesthetic, or narratives portrayed among the photographs._

For example, the following set of images can be considered a series due to the same night-time setting and the shared set of colours existing in all the images.
