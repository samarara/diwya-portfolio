  Growing up in an apartment building for most of my life has changed my
  perspective on the places and things that surround us. There was no intent for
  architectural beauty or purpose in that building, but the experiences that it
  had undergone through time could not be replicated. The building was unique,
  interactive, and played an integral role in many people’s lives, including my
  own. It captured and connected everything about our world in one structure,
  and in result, I viewed it as a work of art. Since then, I have gained an
  appreciation for all of my surroundings. Moreover, I view humans and the
  places that we experience as one entity, because we are a product of all our
  interactions with our surroundings and every surrounding has a distinct
  identity through the people that has interacted with it. The central theme for
  all of my artwork documents this relationship where humans and our external
  environment can be thought of as one work of art. 


  Photography is a key medium that I use, because like every place or structure,
  the photograph captures a specific moment in time that cannot be replicated,
  and therefore increases our awareness of the art that encompasses us.

  My passion for contemporary art and photography drove me into product design.

  I try to approach my personal artwork and product design in the same way,

  focusing on the intentionality behind my decisions to make my audience (or

  users) feel empowered. 





  I hope to design and create for social good, and I aspire to become a

  teacher/mentor in this industry. I’m able to do this right now by leading

  \[UWaterloo’s design club UW/UX](https://www.facebook.com/uwuxwaterloo/) and

  volunteering at events like \[Make-A-Mark](https://letsmakeamark.org/sf/).

  Outside of design, I enjoy baking, tea-making, dance and basketball.
