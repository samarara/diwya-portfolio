In this series I took photographs of places that I visited frequently and used these prints to create folded paper structures. The folds were decided based on the lines that were produced from each building. In result, the paper structure is a distorted visualization on how the space actually looks. I then took photographs of these paper structures which added a more skewed perspective on the original space. These images express how humans can never completely see the entirety of what they experience, even if it is something they are well known to. The lines I focused on to fold are different than what others in those same spaces would focus on. Each paper structure and photograph does not encompass the whole space, representing how all people have a unique yet limited perspective on the places that they interact with. Furthermore, this relates to how photography can capture a unique moment in time with only the perspective of one individual.
