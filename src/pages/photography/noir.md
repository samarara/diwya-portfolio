The suburbs is thought of as a uniform, ordinary and boring environment. What I hope to depict in this series is the opposite.  

In this ongoing series, I try and capture the suburbs in settings of intensity or drama. The process of making this series is equally of value to me, as I'm trying to pay more close attention to the environments that I see and interact with daily.
